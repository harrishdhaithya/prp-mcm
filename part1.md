🔹 Answer (Detailed Bullet-Point Exam Skeleton)

Definitions / Introduction
• Moral relativism holds that moral truths are not absolute but depend on individual or societal beliefs, meaning no single moral judgement can claim universal validity.
• Cultural relativism argues that moral norms and values must be understood within their cultural and social context, discouraging external moral judgement.
• The examiner expects clear differentiation, application to state actions, and ethical evaluation rather than description alone.

Core Explanation
• Moral relativism focuses on subjective or group-based moral standards, which may lead to ethical paralysis when evaluating harmful actions.
• Cultural relativism emphasises respect for cultural practices but risks excusing human rights violations when applied uncritically.
• In IT contexts, these theories affect how surveillance, censorship, or data access by governments is ethically assessed.

Application / Examples
• Blocking websites or accessing phone data may be justified locally but conflict with international privacy norms.
• A relativist approach may accept such actions domestically while external observers view them as rights violations.
• Contextual Integrity helps analyse whether information flows violate contextual norms rather than abstract rights.

Evaluation / Critique
• Consequentialism may justify state surveillance if societal security benefits outweigh privacy harms.
• Deontology would reject such actions if they violate duties or rights regardless of outcomes.
• Virtue ethics examines whether state actors display moral character such as justice and restraint.
• Social contract theory questions whether citizens have meaningfully consented to such practices.

Conclusion
• Moral and cultural relativism provide tools for understanding diversity but must be balanced against universal ethical principles.
• A combined approach allows ethical judgement without cultural imperialism while still criticising unjust practices.

Marks: 13

🔹 Answer (Detailed Bullet-Point Exam Skeleton)

Definitions / Introduction
• Moral relativism is the ethical position that moral judgements are not universally true but depend on individual or group beliefs, meaning that right and wrong vary between societies or persons rather than being absolute.
• Cultural relativism is the view that moral values and practices should be understood within their cultural context, and that judging another culture by one’s own standards risks ethnocentrism.
• The examiner expects a clear distinction between the two concepts, followed by application to state actions involving privacy, surveillance, or censorship.

Core Explanation
• Moral relativism focuses on subjectivity in moral judgement, suggesting that there is no single correct moral standard applicable to all societies or situations.
• Cultural relativism places emphasis on social norms and traditions, arguing that behaviours must be evaluated relative to the culture in which they occur.
• In IT and data contexts, these approaches influence how actions such as surveillance, website blocking, or data access are morally assessed.

Application / Examples
• A government blocking websites may be viewed as morally acceptable internally while being criticised internationally.
• Accessing phone data may be culturally normalised in security-focused states but seen as a rights violation elsewhere.
• Nissenbaum’s Contextual Integrity can be used to analyse whether information flows violate context-specific norms rather than abstract moral rules.

Evaluation / Critique
• From a consequentialist perspective, such actions may be justified if they maximise overall social welfare or security.
• A deontological approach would criticise relativism if it permits violations of fundamental rights such as privacy or autonomy.
• Virtue ethics would focus on the character of decision-makers, questioning whether actions demonstrate justice, restraint, and respect.
• Social contract theory examines whether citizens have implicitly or explicitly consented to such practices.

Conclusion
• Moral and cultural relativism help explain moral disagreement but risk excusing harmful practices if applied uncritically.
• A balanced ethical judgement recognises cultural context while still appealing to broader ethical principles when evaluating state actions.

Appeared in:
2019_Sem1, 2021_Resit, 2022_Sem1, 2023_Sem1, 2024_Resit

Marks: 12–13

🔹 Answer (Detailed Bullet-Point Exam Skeleton)

Definitions / Introduction
• Natural privacy refers to privacy that arises from physical or practical constraints, such as distance, obscurity, or effort required to access information.
• Normative privacy refers to socially agreed expectations about how personal information should be collected, used, and shared.
• Contextual Integrity, developed by Helen Nissenbaum, evaluates privacy based on appropriate information flows within specific social contexts.

Core Explanation
• Natural privacy has been eroded by digital technologies that remove physical barriers to information access.
• Normative privacy depends on norms, roles, and expectations within a given context, such as education or healthcare.
• Contextual Integrity focuses on actors, attributes, transmission principles, and context.

Application / Examples
• Phone data breaches violate normative privacy even if data was technically accessible.
• A professor sharing alumni emails may breach contextual norms despite benign intentions.
• Contextual Integrity assesses whether information flows align with contextual expectations.

Evaluation / Critique
• Consequentialism may downplay privacy violations if benefits outweigh harms.
• Deontology emphasises duties to respect informational autonomy.
• Virtue ethics examines trustworthiness and respect.

Conclusion
• Contextual Integrity bridges natural and normative privacy by grounding privacy analysis in social norms.
• It provides a flexible yet structured framework for evaluating modern privacy dilemmas.

Appeared in:
2019–2024 (multiple papers)

Marks: 12–15

🔹 Answer (Detailed Bullet-Point Exam Skeleton)

Definitions / Introduction
• A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning that undermines the logical validity or soundness of an argument.
• Fallacies often appear persuasive but fail under critical examination.
• The examiner expects clear definitions, reasoning structure, and concrete examples.

Core Explanation
• Appeal to authority relies on an authority figure rather than evidence.
• Ad hominem attacks the person rather than the argument.
• Texas sharpshooter selects data to fit a conclusion.
• Anecdotal fallacy relies on personal experience instead of systematic evidence.

Application / Examples
• Political debates often misuse experts selectively.
• Correlation not causation errors appear in data analytics.
• The ‘fallacy fallacy’ assumes an argument is false solely because it contains a fallacy.

Evaluation / Critique
• Consequentialism warns against poor decisions based on flawed reasoning.
• Deontology values rational honesty.
• Virtue ethics promotes intellectual humility.

Conclusion
• Recognising fallacies improves ethical and professional judgement.
• Not all informal reasoning is fallacious; context and evidence matter.
