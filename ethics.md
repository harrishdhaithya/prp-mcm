* **Complexity / uncertainty:** Individuals may feel issues are too complex to discuss; counter-argument: ethical frameworks and structured reasoning simplify complex dilemmas.
* **Cultural or moral relativism excuses:** Some may defer discussion citing differing norms; counter-argument: relativism does not eliminate professional responsibilities and universal principles exist in IT ethics.

**Analysis / Critique**

* Stoppers can lead to unchecked unethical practices, lowering professional accountability.

**Appeared in:**
2020_Sem1.pdf, 2021_Sem1.pdf, 2023_Sem1.pdf, 2022_Resit.pdf

**Marks:** 13

**Answer (Bullet-Point Exam Skeleton):**

**Introduction / Definitions**

* Moral Relativism: ethical standards vary by individual or personal belief.
* Cultural Relativism: ethical standards vary by societal or cultural norms.

**Main Arguments / Core Content**

* Moral relativism emphasizes subjective reasoning; cultural relativism emphasizes social consensus.
* In IT/privacy cases (e.g., government accessing phone data), moral relativism focuses on individual rights, cultural relativism on societal norms.
* Ethical judgement may differ: a practice acceptable in one culture may violate universal human rights principles.

**Analysis / Comparison / Critique**

* Strengths: fosters respect for diversity, avoids ethnocentric bias.
* Weaknesses: can excuse unethical practices, complicates cross-border regulation compliance.
* Example: surveillance laws in authoritarian states vs EU GDPR principles.

**Conclusion / Examiner-Friendly Wrap-Up**

* Understanding both forms of relativism enables nuanced ethical decision-making in global IT contexts.

**Appeared in:**
2019_Sem1.pdf, 2020_Sem1.pdf, 2021_Sem1.pdf, 2022_Resit.pdf, 2024_Sem1.pdf

**Marks:** 12–15

**Answer (Bullet-Point Exam Skeleton):**

**Introduction / Definitions**

* Logical fallacies are reasoning errors that undermine argument validity.
* They often appear in public debates, ethical discussions, and policy arguments.

**Main Arguments / Core Content**

* **Appeal to authority:** Using authority as sole justification; example: “This software is ethical because a CEO says so.”
* **Ad hominem:** Attacking the person, not the argument; example: criticising a whistleblower instead of their claim.
* **Texas sharpshooter:** Emphasising data supporting a conclusion while ignoring conflicting data; example: selective statistics on AI bias.
* **Anecdotal fallacy:** Using personal experience over broader evidence; example: “I never had a privacy breach, so surveillance isn’t a problem.”
* **Circular reasoning:** Conclusion repeats premise; example: “The software is ethical because it behaves ethically.”
* **Appeal to the populace / bandwagon:** Claim is true because many believe it.
* **Correlation not causation:** Mistaking correlation for causation; example: more AI use correlates with higher productivity, so AI causes it.

**Analysis / Comparison / Critique**

* Fallacy fallacy: assuming an argument is false solely because it contains a fallacy; counter-example: a claim may be true despite fallacious reasoning elsewhere.

**Conclusion / Examiner-Friendly Wrap-Up**

* Recognising fallacies ensures ethical reasoning is logically valid and defensible.

#### Question 4 – Ethical Issues in Automated Face Recognition / ML / Data Mining

**Appeared in:**
2019_Sem1.pdf, 2020_Sem1.pdf, 2021_Resit.pdf, 2022_Sem1.pdf, 2024_Resit.pdf, 2023_Sem1.pdf, 2024_Sem1.pdf

**Marks:** 12–16

**Answer (Bullet-Point Exam Skeleton):**

**Introduction / Definitions**

* Automated face recognition and ML create ethical challenges due to privacy, bias, and accountability concerns.
* Classical logical structure helps frame these issues with premisses and conclusions.

**Main Arguments / Core Content**

* **Privacy violations:** Unauthorised surveillance, data collection, or misuse. Premise: system collects images without consent; Conclusion: individual privacy rights are violated.
* **Algorithmic bias:** Disproportionate misidentification of certain demographics. Premise: training data is biased; Conclusion: decisions reinforce discrimination.
* **Accountability / responsibility gaps:** Unclear liability for errors. Premise: automated system makes a decision; Conclusion: determining responsibility is difficult.
* **Data security risks:** Large biometric datasets are targets for cyberattacks.

**Analysis / Comparison / Critique**

* Benefits: enhanced security, operational efficiency.
* Weaknesses: ethical risks may outweigh benefits if unmanaged.
* Example: misidentification in public spaces causing wrongful arrests.

**Conclusion / Examiner-Friendly Wrap-Up**

* Mitigation requires ethical frameworks, transparency, and adherence to privacy laws.
